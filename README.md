## What is Traffic Sign Recognition? 
* Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR) is an advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) that recognizes and relays traffic sign information to drivers via the instrument panel, multimedia, or heads-up display. In the United States, TSR systems can recognize speed limit signs, do not enter signs, and stop signs. Some can even detect yield signs, though it depends on the model. TSR aims to help make drivers more aware and able to make better safer driving decisions.  

## How does Traffic Sign Recognition work? 
* Traffic Sign Recognition uses advanced forward-facing cameras, generally mounted to the windshield, near the rear-view mirror. The camera handles road sign detection, and software processes them to classify what certain traffic signs mean. After traffic sign classification, the information is relayed to the driver, nearly in real-time.
